/*Rotate by Day of Week: Use HTML/CSS & JavaScript to create a single page that rotates 
unique colors and content for each weekday (Sunday to Saturday) into the page.  The 
content must include:

One unique image, with appropriate and matching content in the alt tag.
A paragraph or two of content that describes the daily item (paragraph must include 
  the name of the highlighted weekday)
A unique color that supports the image and paragraph of content
The unique color could affect the background HTML, or an element on the page for 
each day of the week.  All of the above must occur within one page.
